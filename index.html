                  guarded You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes (...) And I remember that fight, 2:30 AM As
                  everything was slipping right out of our hands I ran out, crying, and you followed me out into the
                  street Braced myself for the goodbye 'Cause that's all I've ever known Then you took me by surprise
                  You said, "I'll never leave you alone" You said, "I remember how we felt, sitting by the water And
                  every time I look at you, it's like the first time I fell in love with a careless man's careful
                  daughter She is the best thing that's ever been mine"

                  know it's no good (...) I run my fingers through your hair And watch the lights go wild Just keep on
                  keeping your eyes on me It's just wrong enough to make it feel right And lead me up the staircase
                  Won't you whisper soft and slow I'm captivated by you, baby Like a fireworks show

                  you take a moment? Promise me this That you'll stand by me forever But if, God forbid, fate should
                  step in And force us into a goodbye If you have children someday When they point to the pictures
                  Please tell them my name(...)Long live the walls we crashed through I had the time of my life with
